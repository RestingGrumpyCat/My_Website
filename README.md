What-is-in-my-fridge
Whatâ€™s in My Fridge is a modern webapp that I developed independently with a client-server format. The webpage allows users to submit a list of ingredients which they currently have in their kitchen, and the app will then find and display recipes which use specifically the given ingredients. The backend is implemented using the Python Django framework, which is made available to the ReactJS frontend using a REST interface. Information regarding recipe instructions and ingredients are retrieved from an external API, however regularly searched ingredients have their associated recipes stored in a PostgresSQL database to save API calls. The website is currently deployed on Amazon EC2 at www.j- abbit.com.
